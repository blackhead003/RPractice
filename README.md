#Purpose of this Repo

In this repository I will be saving different R Files which I will be making for various analysis.

##1. JY Analysis

#### Objective :- To find out which state has the most number of people coming for Jagriti Yatra this year

To get this, I downloaded the names and states from the Jagriti Yatra website and put them in a CSV. 

Made a bar graph with ggplot2 and here it is :-

It turns out that most number of people are coming from Maharashtra.
